    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each chemical element is represented by its symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented by using <i>chemical equations.</i>Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> <span style="font-size: small;" class="material-symbols-outlined">
        arrow_forward
        </span>  2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i> to form water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O).</i></p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoicheometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reaction. It involves balancing chemical equation to ensuree mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscript</sup> indicates the charge or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
