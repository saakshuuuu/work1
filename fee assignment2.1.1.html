    <div> <h2>Mount Everest</h2>
        <p>Mount Everest (also Mount Sagarmatha or Mount Qomolangma)[note 4] is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[3] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently
             established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities. Mount Everest attracts
              many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet.
              While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of May 2024, 340 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain 
              on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.[ </p>

        <h2>Ama Dablam</h2>
        <p>Ama Dablam is a mountain in the eastern Himalayan range of Koshi Province, Nepal. The main peak is 6,812 metres (22,349 ft), the lower western peak is 6,170 metres (20,243 ft). Ama Dablam means "mother's necklace"; the long ridges on each side like the arms of a mother (ama) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier thought of as the dablam, the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods, worn by Sherpa women.[3] For several days, Ama Dablam dominates the eastern sky for anyone trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp. For its soaring ridges and steep faces Ama Dablam is sometimes
             referred as the "Matterhorn of the Himalayas."[4] The mountain is featured on the one rupee Nepalese banknote.
             Although Alfred Gregory led the first attempt on Ama Dablam in 1958[6] it was on 13 March 1961 that the first successful ascent was made, when Mike Gill (NZ), Barry Bishop (US), Mike Ward (UK) and Wally Romanes (NZ) ascended the Southwest Ridge. They were well-acclimatised to altitude, having wintered over at 5,800 metres (19,029 ft) near the base
              of the peak as part of the 1960–61 Silver Hut expedition, led by Sir Edmund Hillary.</p>
